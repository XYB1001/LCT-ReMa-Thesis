TO DO

- Create new result sheet, excluding 'useless' results from old one
- Run currently best ones with each classifier with word BI-grams!
- Once above is done, see if removing some 'intentional' abbreviations is useful.
(Who knows, this  might not be useful...)



IDEA: Formulate task as a ranking task?
Given a pair of samples, can you correctly identify which one is higher ranked?

Method: need to find a heuristic of feeding in the representations of 2 samples simultaneously. (Recall neural architectures:
there, we could have things like Siamese network etc. And generally, with DENSE vector representations, you could just concat
the two vectors, or take their average or max ...).

Eval: just accuracy. How many pairs received the correct label.
Label being 0 or 1: 0 = first sample is higher. 1 = second sample is higher.


If we do it accross all data:
Probably way too many samples, imagine all the possible pairs you can make out of thousands of samples!
With n samples, you get (n-1)! pairs! (right?...)

So, instead, take a random selection of pairs fullfilling the following

Can have 3 settings:
- compare samples with distance of 5 between them
- compare samples with distance of 3 between them
- compare samples with distance of 1 between them, i.e. where labels are just next to each other.

Obviously: hypothesis is that in conditions with larger distance, accuracy will be higher.
But: is this indeed the case? Especially: also in the SM data?
