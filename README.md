*Working Abstract*  


The present project addresses the automatic classification of textual data produced by ESL (English as a Second Language) learners to their proficiency levels in English. In particular, we use the widely accepted CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) levels, which makes the task under discussion a six-class text classification problem.  

Labelled data for learner proficiency classification are mainly drawn from ESL exams, representing texts produced in a regulated and formal context, typically in response to a specific prompt. In this project we attempt to detect the proficiency of ESL learners’ spontaneous text production by classifying their written output on social media websites. We examine whether the predictive features for classifying exam texts are also predictive in the social media domain, whether we observe any useful features specific to web language, and whether features learned from the social media domain can help to improve classification accuracy in the exam context.  

One the one hand, we use labelled data drawn from the EF-Cambridge Open Language Database (EFCamDat), which contains learner writings from the online English course *EF English Live*. On the other hand, we harvest data from Twitter and Reddit which contain users’ self-report of their ESL level and treat these reports as a proxy of their true proficiency label.
